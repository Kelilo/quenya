# Quenya

Quenya consists of 3 parts:

1. a parser to translate quenya language to other API definitions, e.g. OpenAPI v3.
2. a code generator to generate API implementation based on quenya language.
3. a playground to play with API or API stub.

## Quenya language

Quenya language is an extension to OpenAPI v3. It provides further functionalities for better server code generation.
